								<p>Food is distributed to in five main stages, beginning with the harvest of the produce, followed by the storage, then the manufacturing and distribution, and finally the result is given to the consumer to be consumed. During these stages around 40% of the food initially. The two main ways through which food is wasted is the harvesting and consumption process.  Throughout harvesting, food is wasted due to poor storage practice and overharvesting, and when the food finally reaches the consumer the food is wasted as a result of the consumer overbuying which eventually leads to the food going bad and being thrown out. In an effort to reduce the amount of wasted food that is produced a program that gathers sensor based data from companies, using OSIsoft Pi system, will be used. The data collected from the companies will included the food purchased but not sold, how much an item is sold, and trends in the demand with respect to the season. Given this information the general quantity demanded by the population in an area can be calculated, thus a prediction on purchasing patterns can be determined.  This information can be sold and the resulting profit can be used to improve the storage practices to reduce the amount of food lost during the harvest stage. The data collected will allow for companies to adjust their supply of a certain item given its current demand.  This will also allow producers to have a better idea about how much to produce which can lead to less overharvesting and ultimately lessen the total food wasted. Over time more data will be collected and the trends with become more evident in the results concluded which will only increase the effectiveness of the program in the future. Along with our program, bringing awareness to the situation at hand will largely reduce the amount of waste at the consumer level. By showing the average consumer how much wasted food is produced and how it would benefit them economically it would give them a reason to be more mindful about wasting food. Along with awareness, programs would be implemented that working with companies such as EOMS to collected the food that consumers have purchased but haven’t used. This wasted produce can be collected in bins similar to trash and recycle bins, however instead the unused produced we be put to better use in ways such as fertilizer or compost instead of decomposing in landfills. The fertilizer and compost can then be redistributed back to the farms to help improve the harvest by putting nutrients back into the ground and help minimize the more harmful materials used in the synthetic fertilizers by creating a more environmentally safe substitute in compost.</p>

										<p>The process begins, as mentioned previously, by collecting sensor based data from companies, using OSIsoft Pi system. This information will include the inventories and stock of every store available, its sales, and its wasted produce on a daily bases. This data will be transmitted directly after it acquisition at the store level, thanks to partnerships that will benefit both fronts mutually. After gathering all this data, we will pass it through our intricately designed algorithm. This algorithm will generate demand trends which take into account location, season, and buying patterns. By finding average price levels for specific items at every store, and then comparing these averages with the averages of other local retailers, we will generate an accurate model for demand. The algorithm is still in the process of being refined and coded and has not had a complete trial, however, upon its completion, it’s implications will be impressive. </p>		</div>
